/* 
For this SQL project, I queried a simulated EMR patient database to gather insights reagrding patient demographics, encounters, immunizations, and COVID-19.

Data collected from Synthea through Data Wizardry: https://datawizardry.academy/sql-basics-healthcare/

Objectives: Conduct flu shots dashboard for 2022 that does the following:

1.) Total % of patients getting flu shots stratifies by:
	a.) Age
	b.) Race
	c.) County (On a Map)
	d.) Overall
2.) Running total number of flu shots over the course of 2022
3.) Total number of flu shots given in 2022
4.) A list of patients showing whether or not they received the flu shots

Requirements:
Patients must have been "Active at our hospital"
