# Jenna Mejia's SQL Portfolio
Hello! This repository contains examples of SQL I've written for solo projects while working with PostgreSQL and other data analytics courses. Feel free to take a look around and [reach out ](www.linkedin.com/in/jennamejia) if you have any feedback or questions.

## Highlighted Projects
- **Mental Health Survey** - [SQL](https://github.com/jennamejia/My-SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/Mental_Health_Survey): In this project, I worked with data from a mental health survey, which measures attitudes and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace in 2014. I queried insights regarding response rates to specified questions about mental health resources and awareness in the workplace (i.e. stratified percentages of responses to employer benefits, seeking professional treatment, being provided resources to learn more about mental health issues and observed negative consquences, etc.)
- **US Covid-19 Project**- [SQL](https://github.com/jennamejia/My-SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/US-covid19-project): In this project, I worked with New York Times' COVID-19 data to gather insights about COVID-19 cases and deaths in the US. Data from [The New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data), based on reports from state and local health agencies.
- **Flu Shots Data**- [SQL](https://github.com/jennamejia/My-SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/flu-shots-data): In this project, I queried the same simulated EMR patient database to conduct a Flu Shots dashboard for 2022 that provides information about a set of specific criteria (i.e. stratified percentages of patients getting flu shots, running total number of flu shots in 2022, list of patients who have/have not received their flu shot in 2022, etc.)
- **Simulated EMR Database**- [SQL](https://github.com/jennamejia/My-SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/simulated-EMR-database): In this project, I queried a simulated EMR patient database from Synthea to gather insights regarding patient demographics, encounters, immunizations, and COVID-19. Data was organized according to patient age, race, gender, birthplace, frequency of different patient encounter class (such as urgent care, wellness, outpatient, ambulatory, etc.), as well as patient encounter descriptions. I then gathered insights about immunizations and specific COVID-19 information.
- **Winston's Donut Logs** - [SQL](https://github.com/jennamejia/My-SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/Winstons-Donut-Logs): In this project, I used a dataset from the Khan Academy: Querying and Managing Data course to analyze trends in a given table of the number of donuts Winston has eaten in his lifetime.
