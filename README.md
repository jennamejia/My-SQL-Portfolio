# Jenna Mejia's SQL Portfolio
Hello! This repository contains examples of SQL and some Python I've written for solo projects while working with PostgreSQL, MySQL, Jupyter and other data analytics courses. Feel free to take a look around and [reach out ](www.linkedin.com/in/jennamejia) if you have any feedback or questions.

## Highlighted Projects
- **Insurance Claim Project**- [Python](https://github.com/jennamejia/My-SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/Insurance%20Claim%20Project.py): Utilized Python to conduct an exploratory data analysis on a Health Insurance Claim dataset, using Boxplots, as well as Group by, Aggregating, and crosstabs in Pandas
- **COVID Data Exploration Project**- [SQL](https://github.com/jennamejia/My-SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/COVID%20Data%20Exploration%20Project.sql): In this project, I worked with data about COVID-19 Deaths from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). The skills I used include Joins, CTE's, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Converting Data Types.
- **Mental Health Survey**- Part 1: [SQL](https://github.com/jennamejia/My-SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/Mental_Health_Survey%201%20SQL): In this project, I worked with data from a mental health survey, which measures attitudes and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace in 2014. Using Aggregate Functions, Case Statements, I queried insights regarding response rates to specified questions about mental health resources and awareness in the workplace.
Part 2: [Python](https://github.com/jennamejia/My-SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/Mental_Health_Survey%202%20EDA%2C%20Visualization.py): Using Python, I conducted an exploratory data analysis in Pandas to discover potential patterns or trends in the data, and created visualizations in MatPlotLib
- **US Covid-19 Project**- [SQL](https://github.com/jennamejia/My-SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/US-covid19-project): In this project, I worked with New York Times' COVID-19 data to gather insights about COVID-19 cases and deaths in the US. Data from [The New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data), based on reports from state and local health agencies. The skills I used include Limit Clauses, Joins, Subqueries, Mathematical and String Operations.
- **Flu Shots Data**- [SQL](https://github.com/jennamejia/My-SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/flu-shots-data): In this project, I queried a simulated EMR patient database to conduct a Flu Shots dashboard for 2022 that provides information about a set of specific criteria. The skills I used include CTE's, Case Statements, and Joins.
- **Simulated EMR Database**- [SQL](https://github.com/jennamejia/My-SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/simulated-EMR-database): In this project, I queried a simulated EMR patient database to gather insights regarding patient demographics, encounters, immunizations, and COVID-19. Data was organized according to patient age, race, gender, birthplace, frequency of different patient encounter class (such as urgent care, wellness, outpatient, ambulatory, etc.), as well as patient encounter descriptions. The skills I used include Aggregate Functions, Joins, Date Functions, Case Statements, Subqueries.
- **Winston's Donut Logs** - [SQL](https://github.com/jennamejia/My-SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/Winstons-Donut-Logs): In this project, I used a dataset from the Khan Academy: Querying and Managing Data course to analyze trends in a given table of the number of donuts Winston has eaten in his lifetime. The skills I used include Create Table Statements, Multiple Conditions, Data Filtering, Mathematical Operations.
