# Jenna Mejia's SQL Portfolio
Hello! This repository contains examples of SQL I've written for solo projects while working with PostgreSQL and other data analytics courses. Feel free to take a look around and [reach out ](www.linkedin.com/in/jennamejia) if you have any feedback or questions.

## Highlighted Projects
- **Winston's Donut Logs** - [SQL](https://github.com/jennamejia/My-SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/Winstons-Donut-Logs): In this project, I used a dataset from the Khan Academy: Querying and Managing Data course to analyze trends in a given table of the number of donuts Winston has eaten in his lifetime.
- **Simulated EMR Database**- [SQL](https://github.com/jennamejia/My-SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/simulated-EMR-database): In this project, I queried a simulated EMR patient database from Synthea to gather insights regarding patient demographics, encounters, immunizations, and COVID-19. I also used Data Wizardy's [SQL tables](https://github.com/Data-Wizardry/SQL-Webinar-1 ) to gather insights about patient age, race, gender, and birthplace, the frequency of different patient encounter class (such as urgent care, wellness, outpatient, ambulatory, etc.), as well as patient encounter descriptions. I then gathered insights about immunizations and specific COVID-19 information.
- **Flu Shots Data**- [SQL](https://github.com/jennamejia/My-SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/flu-shots-data): In this project, I queried the same simulated EMR patient database to conduct a Flu Shots dashboard for 2022 that provides information about a set of specific criteria (i.e. stratified percentages of patients getting flu shots, running total number of flu shots in 2022, list of patients who have/have not received their flu shot in 2022, etc.)
- **US Covid-19 Project**- [SQL](https://github.com/jennamejia/My-SQL-Portfolio/blob/main/US-covid19-project): In this project, I worked with New York Times' COVID-19 to gather insights about COVID-19 cases and deaths in the US. Data from [The New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data), based on reports from state and local health agencies.
